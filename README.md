# What is this?

It is a repository for me to hold some common configuration files that I find myself SSHing to machines frequently.  It also includes a convenience script for putting the files in place.

# What is this not?

A fully featured setup for every setting I ever make on a machine.  I will not be re-implementing any of the existing frameworks like [fresh](https://github.com/freshshell/fresh) or [yadm](https://yadm.io/).  I also don't have any shell config files in here at this time.
